    <h1>Pesticides</h1>
    <p>The term pesticide covers a wide range of compounds including insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, molluscicides, nematicides, plant growth regulators and others</p>
    <h3>Production and Usage of Pesticides</h3>
    <p>The creation of pesticides began in India in 1952 with the foundation of a plant for the development of BHC close to Calcutta, and India is currently the second-biggest producer of pesticides in Asia after China and positions twelfth all around the world (Mathur, 1999). There has been a consistent development in the creation of specialized grade pesticides in India, from 5,000 metric tons in 1958 to 102,240 metric tons in 1998.</p>
    <p>The example of pesticide use in India is not quite the same as that of the world overall. In, India 76% of the pesticide utilized is an insect poison, as against 44% worldwide (Mathur, 1999). The utilization of herbicides and fungicides is correspondingly less weighty. The principle utilization of pesticides in India is for cotton crops (45%), trailed by paddy and wheat.</p>

    <h3>Advantages of Pesticides</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Improving Productivity</h4></li>
        <p>Huge advantages have been gotten from the utilization of pesticides in ranger service, general wellbeing and the homegrown circle – and, obviously, in farming, an area whereupon the Indian economy is to a great extent subordinate. Food grain creation, which remained at a simple 50 million tons in 1948–49, had expanded practically fourfold to 198 million tons before the finish of 1996–97 from an expected 169 million hectares of for all time edited land</p>

        <li><h4>Protection of crop losses/yield reduction</h4></li>
        <p>In medium land, rice significantly under puddle conditions during the basic time frame justified a powerful and monetary weed control practice to forestall decrease in rice yield because of weeds that went from 28 to 48%</p>

        <li><h4>Vector disease control</h4></li>
        <p>Vector-borne diseases are most effectively tackled by killing the vectors. Insecticides are often the only practical way to control the insects that spread deadly diseases such as malaria, resulting in an estimated 5000 deaths each day</p>

        <li><h4>Quality of food</h4></li>
        <p>In nations of the primary world, it has been seen that an eating routine containing new leafy foods far offsets expected dangers from eating extremely low buildups of pesticides in crops. Expanding proof shows that eating leafy foods consistently decreases the danger of numerous tumors, hypertension, coronary illness, diabetes, stroke, and other persistent sicknesses.</p>
    </ol>

    <h3>Disadavantages of Pesticides</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Direct impact on humans</h4></li>
        <p>Assuming that the credits of pesticides remember the improved monetary potential for terms of expanded creation of food and fiber, and enhancement of vector-borne sicknesses, then, at that point, their charges have brought about genuine wellbeing suggestions to man and his current circumstance</p>

        <li><h4>Impact on Environment</h4></li>
        <p>Pesticides can debase soil, water, turf, and other vegetation. As well as killing bugs or weeds, pesticides can be harmful to a large group of different creatures including birds, fish, helpful creepy crawlies, and non-target plants. Bug sprays are by and large the most intensely harmful class of pesticides, however, herbicides can likewise present dangers to non-target organic entities.</p>

        <li><h4>Ground water Contamination</h4></li>
        <p>Groundwater contamination because of pesticides is an overall issue. As per the USGS, somewhere around 143 unique pesticides and 21 change items have been found in ground water, including pesticides from each significant substance class</p>

        <li><h4>Contamination of non target vegetation</h4></li>
        <p>Pesticide sprays can directly hit non-target vegetation, or can drift or volatilize from the treated area and contaminate air, soil, and non-target plants Nearly every pesticide investigated has been detected in rain, air, fog, or snow across the nation at different times of the year</p>
